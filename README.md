# üß† Organize My Data

Organize My Data is a Python package that helps you structure text data according to a specified schema using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Project Structure

```
organize-my-data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ organize_my_data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schema_organizer.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_schema.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input_text.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/organize-my-data.git
cd organize-my-data
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

1. Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Prepare your input:
   - Edit the `input_text.txt` file in the project directory with the text you want to organize.

3. Customize the schema (optional):
   - Edit the `my_schema.json` file in the project directory with your custom schema.

4. Run the organizer:

```bash
organize-my-data
```

The program will use `input_text.txt` as input and save the results to `output.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configuration is stored in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "use_predefined_schema": false,
  "custom_schema_file": "my_schema.json",
  "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview"
}
```

- `use_predefined_schema`: Set to `false` to use a custom schema, `true` to use the predefined schema.
- `custom_schema_file`: Specifies the filename of your custom schema (default is "my_schema.json").
- `model`: Specifies the OpenAI model to use for text organization.

## Custom Schema

When `use_predefined_schema` is set to `false`, the program will use the custom schema specified in `my_schema.json`. Here's an example of a custom schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "product_name": {"type": "string"},
    "product_description": {"type": "string"},
    "product_price": {"type": "string"},
    "product_url": {"type": "string"}
  }
}
```

## Example Input

Here's an example of what your `input_text.txt` might look like:

```
